def test_mmap(filename):
    '''Memory-mapped I/O.
    
    It should be emphasized that memory mapping a file does not cause the
    entire file to be read into memory. That is, itâ€™s not copied into some kind
    of memory buffer or array. Instead, the operating system merely reserves a
    section of virtual memory for the file contents. As you access different
    regions, those portions of the file will be read and mapped into the memory
    region as needed. However, parts of the file that are never accessed simply
    stay on disk. This all happens transparently, behind the scenes.
    
    If more than one Python interpreter memory maps the same file, the
    resulting mmap object can be used to exchange data between interpreters.
    That is, all interpreters can read/write data simultaneously, and changes
    made to the data in one interpreter will automatically appear in the
    others. Obviously, some extra care is required to synchronize things, but
    this kind of approach is sometimes used as an alternative to transmitting
    data in messages over pipes or sockets.
    
    Usage:
    
        >>> test_mmap('_file.data')
        b'Hello World'
